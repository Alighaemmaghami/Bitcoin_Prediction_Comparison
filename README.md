# A Comparative Study of the Bitcoin Price Prediction Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Methods
## Abstract
Awesome returns of Cryptocurrencies has received a
lot of attention in recent years. With more than 60% of
market cap, we are going to predict the Bitcoin prices.
We used three machine learning algorithms including linear regression, Convolutional Neural Network(CNN), and
Long Short-term Memory(LSTM) plus two time series models containing the Prophet, and Auto-Regressive Integrated
Moving Average(ARIMA) model. We found out that the Regression model performed slightly better and was able to
outperform the trivial model of just getting the yesterday’s
price as the forecast of today’s price. Prophet, LSTM and
CNN after a transformation performed more accurate. We
add a simple algorithm that can give us trading orders that
performs 5% better than long-term buy and hold strategy,
which is a significant improvement.

## 1. Introduction
Time series forecasting has been dominated by linear
methods because they are well understood and effective on
many simpler forecasting problems. However, by using
deep learning we are able to automatically learn arbitrary
complex mappings from inputs to outputs [1]. The bitcoin
price prediction that has been worked on in this project is a
regression problem, where the prediction model predicts the
next Bitcoin price based on the previous. We studied, implemented and compared various Machine Learning and deep
learning methods, such as, prophet, Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM).
