# A Comparative Study of the Bitcoin Price Prediction Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Methods
## Abstract
Awesome returns of Cryptocurrencies has received a
lot of attention in recent years. With more than 60% of
market cap, we are going to predict the Bitcoin prices.
We used three machine learning algorithms including linear regression, Convolutional Neural Network(CNN), and
Long Short-term Memory(LSTM) plus two time series models containing the Prophet, and Auto-Regressive Integrated
Moving Average(ARIMA) model. We found out that the Regression model performed slightly better and was able to
outperform the trivial model of just getting the yesterday’s
price as the forecast of today’s price. Prophet, LSTM and
CNN after a transformation performed more accurate. We
add a simple algorithm that can give us trading orders that
performs 5% better than long-term buy and hold strategy,
which is a significant improvement
